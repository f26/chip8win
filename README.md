# chip8win
A CHIP-8 emulator for Windows written in C and using the Windows API.  Tested on Windows 10, but probably works fine on Windows 7 and 11 too.

Keys are mapped as follows:

* 0-9 Number pad
* A-F Keyboard

Emulation speed defaults to 500 Hz but can be increased/decreased by using the number pad + and - keys.

Enjoy!
